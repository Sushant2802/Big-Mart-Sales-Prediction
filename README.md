# Big Mart Sales Prediction

This project predicts sales for various products across different outlets of a retail store chain. The goal is to understand sales patterns and factors influencing them, helping the business make informed decisions.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict the sales of products based on historical data.
- **Dataset**: Big Mart sales dataset.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Outcome**: A machine learning model that predicts product sales with high accuracy.

## File Structure
- `Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Installation
